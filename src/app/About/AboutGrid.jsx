          <p>I'm AJ Smith,</p>
          <p>
            I design stuff, sometimes I draw, but mostly I help visualise
            peoples creative projects and bring these ideas to life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a background in product design although I focus much more on
            the illustration and graphics side of things now. Currently trying
            to find my way through some more animation techniques.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyways take a look around this small corner of the internet and
            feel free to get in touch ! Iâ€™m always open to collaborations and
            new projects.
          </p>
